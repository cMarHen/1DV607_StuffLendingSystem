May expose internal representation by incorporating reference to mutable 
  object 
This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into the 
  internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by 
  untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object would 
  compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do 
  something different. Storing a copy of the object is better approach in 
  many situations.

May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object 
Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the 
  object's fields exposes the internal representation of the object. If 
  instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the 
  mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, 
  you will need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the 
  object is better approach in many situations.
