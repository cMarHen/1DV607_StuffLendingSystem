new model.domain.Item(Member, Item$ItemType, String, String, String, int,

May expose internal representation by incorporating reference to mutable 
  object 
This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into the 
  internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by 
  untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object would 
  compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do 
  something different. Storing a copy of the object is better approach in 
  many situations.

The class name controller.MainController$promptEvent doesn't start with an 
  upper case letter 
Class names should start with an upper case letter 
Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each 
  internal word capitalized. Try to keep your class names simple and 
  descriptive. Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the 
  abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or 
  HTML).
